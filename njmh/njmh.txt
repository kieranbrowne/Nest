Njmh was generated from what was primarily visual tweaks on Jim Bumgardner's 
code. My version of has been lost, however Jim's explains most of how the
film functioned. Instead of Jim's mouse driven app movement of the patterns 
was controlled by two out of sync sine waves. To run the code I downloaded a
version of processing from 2011 so I could still use the antiquated Vector class.
