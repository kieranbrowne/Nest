'Nest' is a short film/animation in 3 channels.  Its imagery has been created algorithmically rather than 
manually, using augmented open source software.  As the space the work is viewed in and its scale are 
controlled and important to the expression of the film, I also consider the work to be an installation. 

My art practice is primarily driven by a desire to understand the world around me.  I am often inspired 
by interdisciplinary concepts, particularly from the sciences.  The film's three channels, 'living, 
breathing,' 'toward nothing' and 'untitled,' are each a different generative representation of the 
observable universe, influenced by different cultural and scholarly contexts.  While specific elements 
of the work can be attributed to specific ideas or traditions the channels take liberties with 
representation and should not be considered as a direct translation of ideas.  'Living, breathing' 
for example examines ideas of organicism pioneered by Ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, but 
inherits the visual imagery of contemporary science, particularly galaxy structures and microscopic 
imagery.  'Toward nothing' represents the "Big Freeze" theory in cosmology which hypothesises that 
the universe will continue expanding and cooling at an accelerating rate until it becomes too cold to 
sustain life.  'Njem' references the repetitive imagery of Islamic geometric patterns.  For Muslims, 
these patterns symbolise infinity, extending beyond the material world in the same way as God.  
'Nest' is not so much passing a judgement or asking comparison of the three representations so much 
as highlighting the desire to understand the universe as a cross-cultural element of humananity.

I find software to be a potent medium for engaging with ideas of the universe.   In the physical world 
complexity emerges out of innumerable iterations of a few simple rules and algorithms.  The same is 
true for the computational processes which construct the imagery of 'Nest'.  The work as such is 
attempting to imitate the mathematical processes which produce the universe.

The title, 'Nest,' references universal nested structures i.e. galaxies made of solar systems made of 
planets, organisms, cells, molecules, atoms, quarks etc. etc.  as well as the structures of the medium 
i.e. nested loops within software.  It also evokes connotations of preciousness which are central to the 
experience of the film.  Here the scale of presentation is important.  In presenting the works on small, 
portable screens I am inviting the viewer to touch and to hold the film in their hands.  The work 
through a representative physical contact with the universe is about connectedness to the world from 
which we emerged.  The pace of the film is slow and contemplative, such as the experience of 
stargazing or watching a fire.  It is these sublime experiences which the film evokes.  It takes inspiration 
from old and new exploration, placing imagery inspired by modern telescopic and microscopic 
technology beside that of the stargazer.
